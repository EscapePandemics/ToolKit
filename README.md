This page summarises the tools described in the ESCAPE report, organised according to the report sections. For each tool, we provide a short running title, contributing institution(s), a brief description, a GitHub link, and reference to publication. 
1. Pathogen archetypes: Introductory tools that support the construction and analysis of pathogen archetypes across multiple diseases.
2. Key epidemiological variables: Tools in this group estimate core quantities such as the serial interval, latent and infectious periods, reproduction numbers, and overdispersion.
3. Reference models: Reference epidemic models that serve as benchmarks for comparison and projecting epidemic outcomes.
4. Epidemic trends & effectiveness of measures: Tools for reconstructing epidemic trajectories and quantifying the impact of public health measures.
